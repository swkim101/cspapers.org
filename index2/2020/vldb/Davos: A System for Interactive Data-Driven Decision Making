Recently, a new horizon in data analytics, prescriptive analytics, is becoming more and more important to make data-driven decisions. As opposed to the progress of democratizing data acquisition and access, making data-driven decisions remains a significant challenge for people without technical expertise. In this regard, existing tools for data analytics which were designed decades ago still present a high bar for domain experts, and removing this bar requires a fundamental rethinking of both interface and backend. At Einblick, an MIT/Brown spin-off based on the Northstar project, we have been building the next generation analytics tool in the last few years. To overcome the shortcomings of existing processing engines, we propose Davos, Einblickâ€™s novel backend. Davos combines aspects of progressive computation, approximate query processing and sampling, with a specific focus on supporting user-defined operations. Moreover, Davos optimizes multi-tenant scenarios to promote collaboration. Both empirical evaluation and user study verify that Davos can greatly empower data analytics for new needs.
