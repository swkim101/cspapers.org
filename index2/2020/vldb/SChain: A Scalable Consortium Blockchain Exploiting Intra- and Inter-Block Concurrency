We demonstrate SChain, a consortium blockchain that scales transaction processing to support large-scale enterprise applications. The unique advantage of SChain stems from the exploitation of both intraand inter-block concurrency. The intra-block concurrency not only takes advantage of the multi-core processor on a single peer but also leverages the capacity of multiple peers. The interblock concurrency enables simultaneous processing across multiple blocks to increase the utilization of various peers. In our demonstration, we use real-time dashboards containing visualization based on the output of SChain to give the attendees interactive explorations of how SChain achieves intraand inter-block concurrency.
