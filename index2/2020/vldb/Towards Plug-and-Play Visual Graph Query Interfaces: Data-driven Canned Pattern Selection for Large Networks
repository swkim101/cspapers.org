 Canned patterns
 (
 i.e.
 , small subgraph patterns) in visual graph query interfaces (a.k.a GUI) facilitate efficient query formulation by enabling
 pattern-at-a-time
 construction mode. However, existing GUIS for querying large networks either do not expose any canned patterns or if they do then they are typically selected manually based on domain knowledge. Unfortunately, manual generation of canned patterns is not only labor intensive but may also lack diversity for supporting efficient visual formulation of a wide range of subgraph queries. In this paper, we present a novel, generic, and extensible framework called TATTOO that takes a data-driven approach to
 automatically
 select canned patterns for a GUI from large networks. Specifically, it first
 decomposes
 the underlying network into
 truss-infested
 and
 truss-oblivious
 regions. Then
 candidate
 canned patterns capturing different real-world query topologies are generated from these regions. Canned patterns based on a user-specified
 plug
 are then
 selected
 for the GUI from these candidates by maximizing
 coverage
 and
 diversity
 , and by minimizing the
 cognitive load
 of the pattern set. Experimental studies with real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of TATTOO. Importantly, this work takes a concrete step towards realizing
 plug-and-play
 visual graph query interfaces for large networks.
