Google services continuously generate vast amounts of application data. This data provides valuable insights to business users. We need to store and serve these planet-scale data sets under the extremely demanding requirements of scalability, sub-second query response times, availability, and strong consistency; all this while ingesting a massive stream of updates from applications used around the globe. We have developed and deployed in production an analytical data management system, Napa, to meet these requirements. Napa is the backend for numerous clients in Google. These clients have a strong expectation of variance-free, robust query performance. At its core, Napa’s principal technologies for robust query performance include the aggressive use of materialized views, which are maintained consistently as new data is ingested across multiple data centers. Our clients also demand � exibility in being able to adjust their query performance, data freshness, and costs to suit their unique needs. Robust query processing and � exible con � guration of client databases are the hallmark of Napa design.
