In this demo, we present RealGraph Web , a web-based platform that provides various kinds of graph analysis services. RealGraph Web is based on RealGraph, a graph engine that addresses the problem of performance degradation in processing real-world big graphs, achieving great performance improvement up to 44 times over existing state-of-the-art graph engines. RealGraph Web runs on a single machine with a web-based interface, thereby allowing users to easily and conveniently enjoy graph analysis services and perform various graph algorithms anywhere on the web . In this demo, we present how a user can analyze a graph on RealGraph Web in three steps and get the analysis result quickly via a graphical user interface.
