Detecting nodes with erroneous values in real-world graphs remains challenging due to the lack of examples and various error scenarios. We demonstrate GEDet , an error detection engine that can detect erroneous nodes in graphs with a few examples. The GEDet framework tackles error detection as a few-shot node classification problem. We invite the attendees to experience the following unique features. (1) Few-shot detection . Users only need to provide a few examples of erroneous nodes to perform error detection with GEDet . GEDet achieves desirable accuracy with (a) a graph augmentation module, which automatically generates synthetic examples to learn the classifier, and (b) an adversarial detection module, which improves classifiers to better distinguish erroneous nodes from both cleaned nodes and synthetic examples. We show that GEDet significantly improves the state-of-the-art error detection methods. (2) Diverse error scenarios . GEDet profiles data errors with a built-in library of transformation functions from correct values to errors. Users can also easily “plug in” new error types or examples. (3) User-centric detection . GEDet supports (a) an active learning mode to engage users to verify detected results, and adapts the error detection process accordingly; and (b) visual interfaces to interpret and track detected errors.
