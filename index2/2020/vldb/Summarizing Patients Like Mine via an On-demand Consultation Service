Using evidence derived from previously collected medical records to guide patient care has been a long-standing vision of clinicians and informaticians, and one with the potential to transform medical practice. We offered an on-demand consultation service to derive evidence from millions of other patients' data to answer clinician questions and support their bedside decision making. We describe the design and implementation of the service as well as a summary of our experience in responding to the first 100 requests. We will also review a new paradigm for a scalable time-aware clinical data search, and to describe the design, implementation, and use of a search engine realizing this paradigm.
