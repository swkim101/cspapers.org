We analyze a threshold contagion process in a graphon. We interpret the graphon as a stochastic network formation model. We investigate whether contagion in networks sampled from a graphon can be predicted by only exploiting information about the graphon. Our main results show that contagion in large but finite networks sampled from a graphon is well approximated by contagion in the graphon. We illustrate our results by providing analytical characterizations of contagion and optimal seeding policies in graphons with finite and with infinite types.
