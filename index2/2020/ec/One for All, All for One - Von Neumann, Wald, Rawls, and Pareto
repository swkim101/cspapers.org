Applications of the maximin criterion extend beyond economics to computer science, politics, and statistics. However, the maximin criterion---be it von Neumann's, Wald's, or Rawls'---draws fierce criticism due to its extremely pessimistic stance. I propose a novel concept, dubbed the optimin criterion, which is based on (Pareto) optimizing the minimal payoffs of tacit agreements. The optimin criterion generalizes and unifies results in various fields: It not only coincides with (i) maximin strategies in zero-sum games, (ii) the core in cooperative games when the core is nonempty, though it exists even if the core is empty, but it also generalizes (iii) Nash equilibrium in n-person constant-sum games, (iv) stable matchings in matching models, and (v) competitive equilibrium.
