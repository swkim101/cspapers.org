The whole globe has cranked up for coping with the COVID-19 situation. The hands-on tutorial targets at providing a comprehensive and pragmatic end-to-end walk-through for building an academic research paper recommender for the use case of COVID-19 related study, with the help of knowledge graph technology. The code examples that demonstrate the theories are reproducible and can hopefully provide value for researchers to build tools that support conducting research to find a cure to COVID-19.
