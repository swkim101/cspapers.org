Pang et.al. [1] presented Max-Mahalanobis center (MMC) loss and argued that MMC loss is adversarial more robust 4 than SCE. The authorâ€™s SCE loss conveys inappropriate supervisory signals to the model, leading to sparse sample 5 density in the feature space. In this reproducibility challenge we verify the claims that training with MMC loss produces 6 adversarially robust models while also enabling accuracy comparably with models trained with SCE loss. 7
