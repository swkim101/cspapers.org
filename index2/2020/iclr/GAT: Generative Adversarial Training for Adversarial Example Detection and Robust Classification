The vulnerabilities of deep neural networks against adversarial examples have become a significant concern for deploying these models in sensitive domains. Devising a definitive defense against such attacks is proven to be challenging, and the methods relying on detecting adversarial samples are only valid when the attacker is oblivious to the detection mechanism. In this paper, we consider the adversarial detection problem under the robust optimization framework. We partition the input space into subspaces and train adversarial robust subspace detectors using asymmetrical adversarial training (AAT). The integration of the classifier and detectors presents a detection mechanism that provides a performance guarantee to the adversary it considered. We demonstrate that AAT promotes the learning of class-conditional distributions, which further gives rise to generative detection/classification approaches that are both robust and more interpretable. We provide comprehensive evaluations of the above methods, and demonstrate their competitive performances and compelling properties on adversarial detection and robust classification problems.
