Data Science is an essential concept for twenty-first century workforce and as a result the need to help all students acquire such skill has recently gained increased attention. However, most smaller schools are currently facing challenges to provide related knowledge and skill to a broad student population. During Spring of 2019, we organized a faculty workshop on "Data Science Pedagogy and Practice" aimed at building and enhancing data science capacity (teaching, research, partnership, collaboration) at our institution. We gathered faculty input on what would be needed for a successful university-wide initiative to incorporate data analytics concepts as a basic component of training across variety of disciplines including science, business and social sciences. We were able to identify certain challenges and opportunities to accommodate deeper coverage of data science in the undergraduate teaching and research, and as a result, we initiated few efforts such as 1) teaching through faculty partnership, 2) module-based integration into existing courses rather than developing new courses, 3) development of reusable course modules and augment that with contextual hand-on projects so that students could appreciate the use of data science in their own career path, 4) facilitation of course preparation and implementation via a small faculty adopter grant, and 5) development of a graduate certificate program in data analytics. In this poster, we report our experience in organizing and implementing the workshop, the key aspects of the university-wide data science efforts initiated as a result of the workshop, and the lessons learned so far from these initiatives.
