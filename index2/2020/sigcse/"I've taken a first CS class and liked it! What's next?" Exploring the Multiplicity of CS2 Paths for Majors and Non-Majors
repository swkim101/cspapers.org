Driven by diverse needs of students, as well as increasing needs of other disciplines, the past two decades have seen a proliferation of emerging variations in how computer science programs approach a second course in the discipline. Approaches more focused on majors include adaptations to a traditional introduction to data structures course that may heavily incorporate object-oriented programming or emphasize using data structures from libraries. Paths that might be concurrent with a traditional CS2, or have greater appeal to non-majors include recent efforts with data science or secure computing. In a world of increasingly limited resources but ever-increasing needs and demands from inside and outside the major, how do we provide solutions? Bringing together educators who are concerned about intermediate CS education will allow participants to hear multiple viewpoints about what the needs are and how various institutions are currently, or are considering, addressing them. The discussion leaders will kick off the conversation with local expertise---one approach of a CS2 course for majors and non-majors that emphasizes data science and modern practical skills such as databases and HTTP, another with new curricula for multiple CS2 courses, and a third with novel approaches in a traditional data structures CS2 course. Attendees will be able to connect with other people interested in the future of course curricula following CS1 and share ideas, resources, successes, and failures. We will be soliciting participants' perspectives on preparing CS2 students for downstream paths, including (i) future courses, (ii) interviews, (iii) internships, and (iv) research projects.
