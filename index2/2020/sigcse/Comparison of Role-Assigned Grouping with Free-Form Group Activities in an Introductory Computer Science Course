We investigated the impact of assigning specific roles in Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) activities versus giving the same group activities without pre-assigned roles. We hoped to show that the group with additional structure would receive tangible benefits: more engagement with partners, greater comprehension of material, heightened content interest, and increased retention. Preliminary results suggest that the proportion of minimally participating students was not statistically significantly different, and neither were the individual assessments. The roled section did have higher scores overall in the course, both in the group activities and also in the final exam; however, the difference was small and not clearly statistically significant. Unexpectedly, disciplinary actions and post course surveys indicate a greater rate of plagiarism on both shared lab reports and individual homework assignments in the free-form group and this may be a factor for instructors to bear in mind when utilizing group activities.
