SIGCSE is a global organization with members from well over one hundred countries, but attendance at SIGCSE conferences is not always reflective of membership as a whole. Attendance at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium is overwhelmingly from the United States, with more than 92% of all attendees in recent years having a U.S. affiliation. This panel, which includes members of the SIGCSE Board and the Symposium International Committee, will present the state of Symposium participation from outside the U.S. in an effort towards understanding what can be done to expand global participation in the Symposium. The panelists span the range from students to long-time faculty and together have computing education experience from seven countries across six continents. The panel will also solicit views from attendees on barriers to global Symposium participation and ways to improve non-U.S. participation in SIGCSE's flagship conference.
