Globally, there is a growing interest in preparing students to develop fluency with computing. The K-12 Computer Science Framework states that by the end of 12th grade, students should be able to create computational artifacts through continuous testing and refining of their products considering unique perspectives of peers. It has been suggested that creative project experiences with iteration based on feedback encourage the development of these computational skills. However, traditional classrooms are more focused on getting the correct answer to standardized questions. Countries such as Mongolia may have particular challenges in offering students opportunities to develop projects, due to pressure from standardized exams for college entry and lack of teachers prepared to lead computational project-based learning (Uyanga, 2006). This is an exploratory study of an 8-session/16-hour intervention course that provided 13 high-school students in Mongolia an opportunity to create, share, and iterate on computational projects. Measurements included assessment of student attitudes and evaluated how they viewed their participation and learning in the course through pre- and post-surveys, analyzing their responses with qualitative coding. Results suggest that the opportunity to create projects was novel for these students; attitudes regarding feedback changed, and iteration was viewed as key in creating computational artifacts. The analysis also highlights the urgency of further research on localizing the K-12 Computer Science Framework throughout different countries to foster these skills and developing structures that allow students to embrace the freedom of project-based learning.
