The increasing globalization of technology has changed the face of computer science. In addition to core technology skills, modern computer scientist must possess cross-cultural communication skills, team management skills, the ability to perform on geographically distributed teams, and an understanding of the big picture in addition to technical ability. Lord Fairfax Community College (LFCC) used a virtual exchange as a teaching tool for introductory computer science concepts. Nineteen students participated in the Global Solutions Sustainability Challenge, a project supported by the Stevens Initiative, which is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State and administered by the Aspen Institute. The project aims to find a sustainable solution to an issue within the hospitality and tourism industry, while providing students an opportunity to learn about a different culture. Over 10 week students learned about the seven big concepts of computer science, marketing, business plans, team work, public speaking, research, leadership, graphic design, application development, and much more. The poster describes the virtual student exchange concept, highlights the experiences and key elements that global virtual exchange offers students without travel expenses.
