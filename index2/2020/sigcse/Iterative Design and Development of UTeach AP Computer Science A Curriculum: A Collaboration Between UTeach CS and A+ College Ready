This poster outlines the goals of and challenges experienced in developing a new project-based Computer Science A curriculum. The curriculum development process was undertaken as a collaboration between curriculum developers from the UTeach Computer Science program at The University of Texas at Austin, a College Board-endorsed provider of CS Principles curriculum and professional development, and a group of highly experienced secondary computer science teachers from A+ College Ready, a program focused on increasing access to and success in Advanced Placement courses for underserved students in Alabama. The curriculum was developed through an iterative design process, incorporating feedback from pilot teachers, STEM pedagogy experts, and culturally responsive reviewers. The resulting curriculum encourages problem solving, critical thinking, and group communication, and engages students in authentic, project- based learning through a collaborative learning process. Additionally, it provides a unique narrative structure to integrate unit projects throughout the course.
