As quantum computation (QC) comes closer to reality, questions arise as to what elements to teach, how to teach it, and to what depth. QC instruction typically depends heavily on advanced math and/or physics. Our interdisciplinary science / computer science / education team co-created quantum computing (QC) learning trajectories (LT), zines, and activities, for young learners. We present the LT's (Superposition, Quantum State, Entanglement, Measurement, and Reversibility) and the iterative process that created them.
