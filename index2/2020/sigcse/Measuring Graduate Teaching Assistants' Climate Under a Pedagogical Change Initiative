An organization with high undergraduate enrollment, the College of Computing and Informatics atUNC Charlotte is undergoing a sustainable pedagogical shift. Our Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) being a crucial part to sustain this change, are also facing a shift in their climate. We aim to present measurement to gauge our GTAs' climate under this pedagogical climate shift. For this purpose, we have analyzed 184 survey responses from GTAs and developed three constructs:Self-Competence, GTA-to-Faculty Relations andCommunity Belonging. Exploratory Factor Analysis was used to identify the underlying factors, exhibiting 13 items retaining to these three constructs with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94. This measurement shows that with engaged classroom practices, we are also fostering an engaged climate for our GTAs.
