Runestone Interactive is an open-source ebook platform (http://runestoneinteractive.org). Runestone supports executable and editable examples in Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, Processing, and SQL. It also includes code visualization/stepping and a wide variety of practice activities, including multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, clickable-code, and mixed-up code (Parsons) problems. A new practice tool reuses ebook content to provide spaced, retrieval-based, and interleaved practice. Free textbooks have been created for CS1, CS2, web development, data science, and Advanced Placement (AP) CS (both CSP and CSA). Over 25,000 people a day use Runestone ebooks. Several studies have demonstrated positive learning and attitude outcomes from the use of interactive ebooks versus static ebooks. The goal of this workshop is to introduce computing teachers (both secondary and post-secondary) to Runestone ebooks. The hands-on session will lead participants through use of the ebooks as if they were students to familiarize them with the interactive features. Participants will next create a custom course from an existing ebook in the library and will use the instructor's dashboard to review student activity, modify the course, grade students, and set up the practice tool. Participants will create their own assignments using existing material in the ebooks. Participants will also be shown how to create new problems for assignments, such as multiple-choice questions for a quiz. The presenters have several years of experience creating, using, and conducting research with Runestone ebooks. Laptop required.
