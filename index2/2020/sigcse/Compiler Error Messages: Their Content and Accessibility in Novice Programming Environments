Improving the feedback that novices receive from programming environments is an important and often overlooked aspect of computing education research. This work in progress examines the effects of various mechanisms by which environments deliver feedback to users. By providing insights on the effects of these mechanisms, we aim to inform designers, developers and educators about more effective design and use of such environments for students.
