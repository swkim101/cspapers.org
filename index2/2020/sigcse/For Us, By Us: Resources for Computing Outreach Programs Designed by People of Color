Computer Science outreach programs for Black and Latinx communities are often led by those who are not of the community for which they are building. While there are programs that exist that are being ran by Black and Latinx men and women, they are often conducted in siloes and are not given the resources that other programs are given. This session will serve as a gathering for Black and Latinx BPC program leaders to share resources that could help with operations, funding, and collaboration amongst themselves and other external stakeholders.
