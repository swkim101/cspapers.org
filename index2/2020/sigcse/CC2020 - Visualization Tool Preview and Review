The CC2020 project was charged with two main objectives, to produce a comprehensive report and a visualization tool to provide global guidance in an evolving computing environment as it affects computing baccalaureate degree programs worldwide. The report is now in draft form and has undergone four rounds of review. The other goal of the CC2020 project is to develop a set of visualization-based tools that will help users to explore questions they may have concerning curricular guidelines, as well as local computing curricula. A visualization tool has been scoped and a prototype built. This special session will unveil the prototype for the SIGCSE community who will have the opportunity to view and review the tool.
