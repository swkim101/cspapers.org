Software is one of the three key pillars in the emerging field of data science, the other two being statistics and domain knowledge. With software engineering having matured into a full-fledged discipline, can it inform data science projects through its extensive knowledgebase? Data scientists of today are experiencing what software engineers experienced around 1970s. We are at the cusp of a new era with many promising opportunities, but we have yet to find a process-centric approach that could guide our data science ventures. Software development methodologies evolved from a structured waterfall to an iterative exploration. They transitioned from trying to create products that are built-to-last to products that are built-to-change. Data science projects, coming from the other end of the spectrum, need to shift from being ever-changing short-lived experiments to long-term sustainable organizational capabilities without losing the ability to explore and adapt. To make this shift, software engineers need to re-articulate their learning in the context of the emerging data science paradigm. Software engineering needs to develop its data science lens. Many tools such as programming languages, database systems, and infrastructural platforms are common across the two worlds, so which of the underlying principles can benefit data scientists? These are the questions that will be explored in this talk and those interested in joining this exploration are welcome to share their thoughts.
