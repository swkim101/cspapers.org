One of the critical needs of the 21st-century workforce development is the recruitment, retention, and graduation of women in STEM fields. Research suggests that women drop out of academic programs and leave the workforce to deal with financial setbacks, tend to personal obligations and offer service in military programs. It is important these women, i.e. returning women, have pathways for reentry to college and opportunities to advance their careers. Some areas within STEM fields, such as Emerging Technology (EmTech) in computer science are expected to experience increases in job opportunities more quickly than traditional areas. The demands of these jobs can only be fulfilled by creating pathways for untapped STEM talent pools, including returning women. Therefore, we propose a panel to discuss the barriers and opportunities women face (re-)entering the STEM education and career paths, especially in EmTech fields. The panel of experts will provide different perspectives to spark conversation and reflection. The objective of the panel is to share experiences, advice, and ideas to advance the current state of knowledge about the complex challenges that women encounter and support structures for their reentry to the education and professional pipeline.
