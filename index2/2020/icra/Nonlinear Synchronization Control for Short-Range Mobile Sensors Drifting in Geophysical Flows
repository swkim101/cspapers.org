This paper presents a synchronization controller for mobile sensors that are minimally actuated and can only communicate with each other over a very short range. This work is motivated by ocean monitoring applications where large-scale sensor networks consisting of drifters with minimal actuation capabilities, i.e., active drifters, are employed. We assume drifters are tasked to monitor regions consisting of gyre flows where their trajectories are periodic. As drifters in neighboring regions move into each other's proximity, it presents an opportunity for data exchange and synchronization to ensure future rendezvous. We present a nonlinear synchronization control strategy to ensure that drifters will periodically rendezvous and maximize the time they are in their rendezvous regions. Numerical simulations and small-scale experiments validate the efficacy of the control strategy and hint at extensions to large-scale mobile sensor networks.
