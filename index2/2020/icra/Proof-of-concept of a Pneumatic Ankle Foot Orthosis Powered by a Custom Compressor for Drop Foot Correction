Pneumatic transmission has several advantages in developing powered ankle foot orthosis (AFO) systems, such as the flexibility in placing pneumatic components for mass distribution and providing high back-drivability via simple valve control. However, pneumatic systems are generally tethered to large stationary air compressors that restrict them for being used as daily assistive devices. In this study, we improved a previously developed wearable (untethered) custom compressor that can be worn (1.5 kg) at the waist of the body and can generate adequate amount of pressurized air (maximum pressure of 1050 kPa and a flow rate of 15.1 mL/sec at 550 kPa) to power a unilateral active AFO used to assist the dorsiflexion (DF) motion of drop-foot patients. The finalized system can provide a maximum assistive torque of 10 Nm and induces an average 0.03±0.06 Nm resistive torque when free movement is provided. The system was tested for two unilateral drop-foot patients. The proposed system showed an average improvement of 13.6° of peak dorsiflexion angle during the swing phase of the gait cycle.
