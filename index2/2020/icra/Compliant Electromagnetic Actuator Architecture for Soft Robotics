Soft materials and compliant actuation concepts have generated new design and control approaches in areas from robotics to wearable devices. Despite the potential of soft robotic systems, most designs currently use hard pumps, valves, and electromagnetic actuators. In this work, we take a step towards fully soft robots by developing a new compliant electromagnetic actuator architecture using gallium-indium liquid metal conductors, as well as compliant permanent magnetic and compliant iron composites. Properties of the new materials are first characterized and then co-fabricated to create an exemplary biologically-inspired soft actuator with pulsing or grasping motions, similar to Xenia soft corals. As current is applied to the liquid metal coil, the compliant permanent magnetic tips on passive silicone arms are attracted or repelled. The dynamics of the robotic actuator are characterized using stochastic system identification techniques and then operated at the resonant frequency of 7 Hz to generate high-stroke (>6 mm) motions.
