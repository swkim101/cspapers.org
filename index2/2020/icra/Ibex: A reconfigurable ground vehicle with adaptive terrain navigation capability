This paper presents a unique unmanned ground vehicle with a dynamic wheelbase and an adaptive thrust based friction optimization scheme that aids in the traversal of steep slopes and slippery surfaces. The vehicle is capable of adapting itself to the surface topography using an impedance-based stabilization module to minimize the mechanical oscillatory transients induced during its motion. A detailed analysis of its modules has been elucidated in this paper based on the vehicle parameters. The proposed methodologies have been integrated and tested on a customized prototype. Experimental validation and simulation for the proposed modules at various terrain conditions have been carried out to authenticate its performance.
