Although autonomous control of robotic manipulators has been studied for several decades, they are not commonly used in safety-critical applications due to lack of safety and performance guarantees - many of them concerning the modulation of interaction forces. This paper presents a mechanical probing strategy for estimating the environmental impedance parameters of compliant environments, independent a manipulatorâ€™s controller design, and configuration. The parameter estimates are used in a position-based adaptive force controller to enable control of interaction forces in compliant, stationary, and non-stationary environments. This approach is targeted for applications where the workspace is constrained and non-stationary, and where force control is critical to task success. These applications include surgical tasks involving manipulation of compliant, delicate, moving tissues. Results show fast parameter estimation and successful force modulation that compensates for motion.
