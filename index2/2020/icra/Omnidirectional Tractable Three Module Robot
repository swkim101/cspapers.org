This paper introduces the Omnidirectional Tractable Three Module Robot for traversing inside complex pipe networks. The robot consists of three omnidirectional modules fixed 120° apart circumferentially which can rotate about their own axis allowing holonomic motion of the robot. The holonomic motion enables the robot to overcome motion singularity when negotiating T-junctions and further allows the robot to arrive in a preferred orientation while taking turns inside a pipe. We have developed a closed-form kinematic model for the robot in the paper and propose the ‘Motion Singularity Region' that the robot needs to avoid while negotiating T-junction. The design and motion capabilities of the robot are demonstrated both by conducting simulations in MSC ADAMS on a simplified lumped-model of the robot and with experiments on its physical embodiment.
