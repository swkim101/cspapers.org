This work presents a novel design concept that achieves multi-legged locomotion using a three-dimensional cam system. A computational framework has been developed to analyze and dimension this cam apparatus, that can perform arbitrary end effector motions within its design constraints. The mechanism enables continuous gait transition and inherent force compliance. With only two motors, any trajectory of a continuous set of gaits can be followed. One motor is used to actuate the system and a second one to morph its movement. To illustrate a possible application of this system, a working prototype of a bipedal robot is developed and validated in hardware. It showcases a smooth velocity change by transitioning through different gaits from standing still to walking fast at 124mm/s within 2.0s, while following the given end effector trajectory with an error of only 2.47mm.
