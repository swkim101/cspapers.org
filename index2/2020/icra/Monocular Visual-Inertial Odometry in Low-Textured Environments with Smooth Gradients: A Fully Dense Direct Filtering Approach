State of the art visual-inertial odometry approaches suffer from the requirement of high gradients and sufficient visual texture. Even direct photometric approaches select a subset of the image with high-gradient areas and ignore smooth gradients or generally low-textured areas. In this work, we show that taking all image information (i.e. every single pixel) enables visual-inertial odometry even on areas with very low texture and smooth gradients, inherently interpolating and estimating the scene with no texture based on its informative surrounding. This information propagation is only possible as we estimate all states and their uncertainties (robot pose, extrinsic sensor calibration, and scene depth) jointly in a fully dense filter framework. Our complexity reduction approach enables real-time execution despite the large size of the state vector. Compared to our previous basic feasibility study on this topic, this work includes higher order covariance propagation and improved state handling for a significant performance gain, thorough comparisons to state-of-the-art algorithms, larger mapping components with uncertainty, self-calibration capability, and real-data tests.
