This paper introduces a novel approach for model predictive control of ballbots for path-following tasks. Ballbots are dynamically unstable mobile robots which are designed to balance on a single ball. The model presented in this paper is a simplied version of a full quaternion-based model of ballbotsâ€™ underactuated dynamics which is suited for online implementation. Furthermore, the approach is extended to handle nearby obstacles directly in the MPC formulation. The presented controller is validated through simulation on a high fidelity model as well as through real-world experiments on a physical ballbot system.
