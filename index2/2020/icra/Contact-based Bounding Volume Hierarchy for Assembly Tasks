Path planning of an object which is allowed to be in contact with other objects during assembly process is a significant challenge due to the variety of permitted or forbidden collisions between the distinct parts of the objects to be assembled. In order to put objects together in real-life scenarios, parts of assembled objects may be required to flex, whereas other parts may have to fit exactly. Consequently, existing collision checking and distance computation algorithms have to be modified to enable path planning of objects that can be in contact during the assembly process. In this paper, we analyze an improved broad phase proximity query algorithm to enable such contact-based assembly tasks we call CHAT (Contact-based Hierarchy for Assembly Tasks). We demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, our proposed method is more than an order of magnitude faster for collision queries and up to three times faster for distance queries when the two objects contain a large number of parts (with some parts containing thousands or tens of thousands of triangles). Due to the nature of the algorithm, we expect the performance improvements to increase as the number of parts in an object becomes larger.
