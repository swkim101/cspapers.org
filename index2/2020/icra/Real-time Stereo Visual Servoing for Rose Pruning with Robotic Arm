The paper presents a working pipeline which integrates hardware and software in an automated robotic rose cutter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first robot able to prune rose bushes in a natural environment. Unlike similar approaches like tree stem cutting, the proposed method does not require to scan the full plant, have multiple cameras around the bush, or assume that a stem does not move. It relies on a single stereo camera mounted on the end-effector of the robot and real-time visual servoing to navigate to the desired cutting location on the stem. The evaluation of the whole pipeline shows a good performance in a garden with unconstrained conditions, where finding and approaching a specific location on a stem is challenging due to occlusions caused by other stems and dynamic changes caused by the wind.
