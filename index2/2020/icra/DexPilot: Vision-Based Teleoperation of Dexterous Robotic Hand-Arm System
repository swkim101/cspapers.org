Teleoperation offers the possibility of imparting robotic systems with sophisticated reasoning skills, intuition, and creativity to perform tasks. However, teleoperation solutions for high degree-of-actuation (DoA), multi-fingered robots are generally cost-prohibitive, while low-cost offerings usually offer reduced degrees of control. Herein, a low-cost, depth-based teleoperation system, DexPilot, was developed that allows for complete control over the full 23 DoA robotic system by merely observing the bare human hand. DexPilot enabled operators to solve a variety of complex manipulation tasks that go beyond simple pick-and-place operations and performance was measured through speed and reliability metrics. DexPilot cost-effectively enables the production of high dimensional, multi-modality, state-action data that can be leveraged in the future to learn sensorimotor policies for challenging manipulation tasks.
