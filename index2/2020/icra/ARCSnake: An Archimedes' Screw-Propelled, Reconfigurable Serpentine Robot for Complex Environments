This paper presents the design and performance of a new locomotion strategy for serpentine robots using screw propulsion. The ARCSnake robot comprises serially linked, identical modules, each incorporating an Archimedes’ screw for propulsion and a universal joint (U-Joint) for orientation control. When serially chained, these modules form a versatile serpentine robot platform which enables the robot to reshape its body configuration for varying environments, typical of a snake. Furthermore, the Archimedes’ screws allow for novel omni-wheel drive-like motions by speed controlling their screw threads. This paper considers the mechanical and electrical design, as well as the software architecture for realizing a fully integrated system. The system includes 3N actuators for N segments, each controlled using a BeagleBone Black with a customized power-electronics cape, a 9 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a scalable communication channel over ROS. This robot serves as the first proof-of-concept demonstration of the NASA-JPL Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS) program that aims to deliver scientific instrumentation deep within the plume vents, caves, and ice sheets of Enceladus and Europa in search for extant lifeforms*.
