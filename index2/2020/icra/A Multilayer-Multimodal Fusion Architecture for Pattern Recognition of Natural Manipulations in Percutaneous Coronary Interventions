The increasingly-used robotic systems can provide precise delivery and reduce X-ray radiation to medical staff in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), but natural manipulations of interventionalists are forgone in most robot-assisted procedures. Therefore, it is necessary to explore natural manipulations to design more advanced human-robot interfaces (HRI). In this study, a multilayer-multimodal fusion architecture is proposed to recognize six typical subpatterns of guidewire manipulations in conventional PCI. The synchronously acquired multimodal behaviors from ten subjects are used as the inputs of the fusion architecture. Six classification-based and two rule-based fusion algorithms are evaluated for performance comparisons. Experimental results indicate that the multimodal fusion brings significant accuracy improvement in comparison with single-modal schemes. Furthermore, the proposed architecture can achieve the overall accuracy of 96.90%, much higher than that of a singlelayer recognition architecture (92.56%). These results have indicated the potential of the proposed method for facilitating the development of HRI for robot-assisted PCI.
