In order to fulfill conflicting requirements in the development of industrial robots, such as increased accuracy of a weightreduced manipulator with lower mechanical stiffness, the robotâ€™s dynamical behavior must be evaluated early in the development process. This leads to the need of accurate multibody models of the manipulator under development.This paper deals with multibody models that include flexible bodies, which are exported from the corresponding Finite Element model of the structural parts. It is shown that such a flexible link manipulator model, which is purely based on development and datasheet data, is suitable for an accurate description of an industrial robot's dynamic behavior. No stiffness parameters need to be identified by experimental methods, making this approach especially relevant during the development of new manipulators. This paper presents results of experiments in time and frequency domain for analyzing the modeling approach and for validating the model performance against real robot behavior.
