Technological advancements have led to increasing availability of erotic literature and pornography novels online, which can be alluring to adolescence and children. Unfortunately, because of the inherent complexity of these indecent contents and training data sparseness, it is a challenging task to detect these readings in the Cyberspace while children can easily access them. In this study, we propose a novel framework, Joint Learning of Content and Human Attention (GoodMan), to identify indecent readings by augmenting natural language understanding models with large scale human reading behaviors (dwell time per page) on portable devices. From the text modeling viewpoint, the innovative joint attention trained by joint learning is employed to orchestrate the content attention and human behavior attention via the BiGRU. From the data augmentation perspective, various users' reading behaviors on the same text can generate considerable training instances with joint attention, which can be effective to address the cold start problem. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on an online ebook dataset (with human reading behaviors on portable devices). The experimental results show insights into the task and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against alternative solutions.
