Misinformation such as fake news has drawn a lot of attention in recent years. It has serious consequences on society, politics and economy. This has lead to a rise of manually fact-checking websites such as Snopes and Politifact. However, the scale of misinformation limits their ability for verification. In this demonstration, we propose BRENDA a browser extension which can be used to automate the entire process of credibility assessments of false claims. Behind the scenes BRENDA uses a tested deep neural network architecture to automatically identify fact check worthy claims and classifies as well as presents the result along with evidence to the user. Since BRENDA is a browser extension, it facilities fast automated fact checking for the end user without having to leave the Webpage.
