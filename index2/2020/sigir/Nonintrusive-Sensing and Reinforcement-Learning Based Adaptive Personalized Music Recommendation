As a particularly prominent application of recommender systems on automated personalized service, the music recommendation has been widely used in various music network platforms, music education and music therapy. Importantly, the individual music preference for a certain moment is closely related to personal experience of the music and music literacy, as well as temporal scenario without any interruption. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel policy for music recommendation NRRS (Nonintrusive-Sensing and Reinforcement-Learning based Recommender Systems) by integrating prior research streams. Specifically, we develop a novel recommendation framework for sensing, learning and adaptation to user's current preference based on wireless sensing and reinforcement learning in real time during a listening session. The established music recommendation prototype monitors individual vital signals for listening music, and captures song characters, individual dynamic preferences, and that it can yield better listening experience for users.
