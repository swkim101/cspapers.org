Identification of new concepts in scientific literature can help power faceted search, scientific trend analysis, knowledge-base construction, and more, but current methods are lacking. Manual identification can't keep up with the torrent of new publications, while the precision of existing automatic techniques is too low for many applications. We present an unsupervised concept extraction method for scientific literature that achieves much higher precision than previous work. Our approach relies on a simple but novel intuition: each scientific concept is likely to be introduced or popularized by a single paper that is disproportionately cited by subsequent papers mentioning the concept. From a corpus of computer science papers on arXiv, we find that our method achieves a Precision@1000 of 99%, compared to 86% for prior work, and a substantially better precision-yield trade-off across the top 15,000 extractions. To stimulate research in this area, we release our code and data.
