Motivated by a success of generative adversarial networks (GAN) in various domains including information retrieval, we propose a novel signed network embedding framework, ASiNE, which represents each node of a given signed network as a low-dimensional vector based on the adversarial learning. To do this, we first design a generator G+ and a discriminator D+ that consider positive edges, as well as a generator G - and a discriminator D- that consider negative edges: (1) G+/G- aim to generate the most indistinguishable fake positive/negative edges, respectsupively; (2) D+/D aim to discriminate between real positive/negative edges and fake positive/negative edges, respectively. Furthermore, under ASiNE, we propose two new strategies for effective signed network embedding: (1) an embedding space sharing strategy for learning both positive and negative edges; (2) a fake edge generation strategy based on the balance theory. Through extensive experiments using five real-life signed networks, we verify the effectiveness of each of the strategies employed in ASiNE. We also show that ASiNE consistently and significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art signed network embedding methods in all datasets and with all metrics in terms of accuracy of sign prediction.
