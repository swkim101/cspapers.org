While the World Wide Web provides a large amount of text in many languages, cross-lingual parallel data is more difficult to obtain. Despite its scarcity, this parallel cross-lingual data plays a crucial role in a variety of tasks in natural language processing with applications in machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, and document classification, as well as learning cross-lingual representations. Here, we describe the end-to-end process of searching the web for parallel cross-lingual texts. We motivate obtaining parallel text as a retrieval problem whereby the goal is to retrieve cross-lingual parallel text from a large, multilingual web-crawled corpus. We introduce techniques for searching for cross-lingual parallel data based on language, content, and other metadata. We motivate and introduce multilingual sentence embeddings as a core tool and demonstrate techniques and models that leverage them for identifying parallel documents and sentences as well as techniques for retrieving and filtering this data. We describe several large-scale datasets curated using these techniques and show how training on sentences extracted from parallel or comparable documents mined from the Web can improve machine translation models and facilitate cross-lingual NLP.
