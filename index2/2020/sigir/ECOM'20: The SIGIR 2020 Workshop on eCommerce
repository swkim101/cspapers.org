eCommerce Information Retrieval (IR) is receiving increasing attention in the academic literature and is an essential component of some of the largest web sites (e.g. Amazon, Alibaba, Taobao, eBay, Airbnb, Target, Facebook). eCommerce organisations consistently sponsor SIGIR, reflecting the importance of IR research to them. This workshop (1) brings together researchers and practitioners of eCommerce IR to discuss topics unique to it, (2) determines how to use eCommerce's unique combination of free text, structured data, and customer behavioral data to improve search relevance, and (3) examines how to build data sets and evaluate algorithms in this domain. Since eCommerce customers often do not know exactly what they want to buy, recommendations are valuable for inspiration, serendipitous discovery and basket building. The theme of this year's eCommerce IR workshop is integrating recommendations into search for eCommerce. In addition to the focus on recommender systems in eCommerce search, Rakuten France is sponsoring a data challenge on taxonomy classification using multi-modal (image, text and structured data) input. The data challenge reflects themes from the 2017--2019 SIGIR workshops.
