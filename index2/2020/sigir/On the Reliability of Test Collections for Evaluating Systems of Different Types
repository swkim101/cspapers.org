As deep learning based models are increasingly being used for information retrieval, a major challenge is to ensure the availability of test collections for measuring their quality. Test collections are usually generated based on pooling results of various retrieval systems, but until recently this did not include deep learning systems. This raises a major challenge for reusable evaluation: Since deep learning based models use external resources (e.g. word embeddings) and advanced representations when compared to traditional methods, they may return different types of relevant document that were not identified in the original pooling. If so, test collections constructed using traditional methods could lead to biased and unfair evaluation results for deep learning systems. This paper uses simulated pooling to test the fairness and reusability of test collections, showing that especially when shallow pools (e.g. depth-10 pools) are used, pooling based on traditional systems only may lead to biased evaluation of deep learning systems.
