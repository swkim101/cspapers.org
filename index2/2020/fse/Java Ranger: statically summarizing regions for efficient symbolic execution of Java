Merging execution paths is a powerful technique for reducing path explosion in symbolic execution. One approach, introduced and dubbed “veritesting” by Avgerinos et al., works by translating abounded control flow region into a single constraint. This approach is a convenient way to achieve path merging as a modification to a pre-existing single-path symbolic execution engine. Previous work evaluated this approach for symbolic execution of binary code, but different design considerations apply when building tools for other languages. In this paper, we extend the previous approach for symbolic execution of Java. Because Java code typically contains many small dynamically dispatched methods, it is important to include them in multi-path regions; we introduce dynamic inlining of method-regions to do so modularly. Java’s typed memory structure is very different from the binary representation, but we show how the idea of static single assignment (SSA) form can be applied to object references to statically account for aliasing. We have implemented our algorithms in Java Ranger, an extension to the widely used Symbolic Pathfinder tool. In a set of nine benchmarks, Java Ranger reduces the running time and number of execution paths by a total of 38% and 71% respectively as compared to SPF. Our results are a significant improvement over the performance of JBMC, a recently released verification tool for Java bytecode. We also participated in a static verification competition at a top theory conference where other participants included state-of-the-art Java verifiers. JR won first place in the competition’s Java verification track.
