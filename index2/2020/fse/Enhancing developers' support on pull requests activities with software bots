Software bots are employed to support developers' activities, serving as conduits between developers and other tools. Due to their focus on task automation, bots have become particularly relevant for Open Source Software (OSS) projects hosted on GitHub. While bots are adopted to save development cost, time, and effort, the bots' presence can be disruptive to the community. My research goal is two-fold: (i) identify problems caused by bots that interact in pull requests, and (ii) help bot designers enhance existing bots. Toward this end, we are interviewing maintainers, contributors, and bot developers to understand the problems in the human-bot interaction and how they affect the collaboration in a project. Afterward, we will employ Design Fiction to capture the developers' vision of bots' capabilities, in order to define guidelines for the design of bots on social coding platforms, and derive requirements for a meta-bot to deal with the problems. This work contributes more broadly to the design and use of software bots to enhance developers' collaboration and interaction.
