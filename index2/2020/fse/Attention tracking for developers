For improving speed and quality of development of IT projects it is essential to study how to increase the efficiency of developers. One way to improve the quality of developers' work is to help them concentrate better, timely detect a drop in concentration and brain fatigue, which could be done by controlling the level of attention during programming. This study focuses on the study of the level of attention of programmers using EEG (electroencephalogram), as the most promising and realistic for use in this environment. We found that the level of attention can be determined using the control of alpha and beta waves measured using EEG, as well as specific features of the functional state of the brain compared to another type of mental load - driving.
