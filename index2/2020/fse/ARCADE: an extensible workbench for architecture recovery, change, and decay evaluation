This paper presents the design, implementation, and usage details of ARCADE, an extensible workbench for supporting the recovery of software systems' architectures, and for evaluating architectural change and decay. ARCADE has been developed and maintained over the past decade, and has been deployed in a number of research labs as well as within three large companies. ARCADE's implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/joshuaga/arcade and the video depicting its use at https://tinyurl.com/arcade-tool-demo.
