Dashboards are software systems aiming to amplify cognition capitalizing on human perceptual abilities. As such, they have intrinsically a human-centric approach, meaning that their purpose is to support effective decision making. This has played a vital role in their success in business performance management, business intelligence, and internal control. However, as today's business requirements change rapidly and continuously, dashboards containing the same set of metrics throughout quickly become ineffective at conveying important information, especially when used by multiple users. This is one of the reasons for adopting the concept of "precooked" dashboards, i.e., building a default template that is useful to an average user.
