Formal methods are promising for modeling and analyzing system requirements. However, applying formal methods to large-scale industrial projects is a remaining challenge. The industrial engineers are suffering from the lack of automated engineering methodologies to effectively conduct precise requirement models, and rigorously validate and verify (V&V) the generated models. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a systematic engineering approach, named Formal Requirement Engineering Platform in Aircraft (FREPA), for formal requirement modeling and V&V in the aerospace and aviation control domains. FREPA is an outcome of the seamless collaboration between the academy and industry over the last eight years. The main contributions of this paper include 1) an automated and systematic engineering approach FREPA to construct requirement models, validate and verify systems in the aerospace and aviation control domain, 2) a domain-specific modeling language AASRDL to describe the formal specification, and 3) a practical FREPA-based tool AeroReq which has been used by our industry partners. We have successfully adopted FREPA to seven real aerospace gesture control and two aviation engine control systems. The experimental results show that FREPA and the corresponding tool AeroReq significantly facilitate formal modeling and V&V in the industry. Moreover, we also discuss the experiences and lessons gained from using FREPA in aerospace and aviation projects.
