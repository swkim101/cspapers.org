Network Architecture. We present our network architecture using 3D Res50 backbone in Table 3. A similar architecture is also used for CSN-152 backbone. We followed [3] to use the features from bottom layers of the network for motor attention prediction and interaction hotspots estimation, and the features from the top layer for action anticipation. Our model jointly predicts motor attention, interaction hotspots and future actions, and thus is conceptually similar to multitask learning e.g., [4]. The key difference is that outputs of our model depends on each other. For example, motor attention is used for interaction hotspots estimation and both motor attention and interaction hotspots are used for action anticipation.
