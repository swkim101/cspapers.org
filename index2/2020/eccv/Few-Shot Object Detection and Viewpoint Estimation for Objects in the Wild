Detecting objects and estimating their viewpoints in images are key tasks of 3D scene understanding. Recent approaches have achieved excellent results on very large benchmarks for object detection and viewpoint estimation. However, performances are still lagging behind for novel object categories with few samples. In this paper, we tackle the problems of few-shot object detection and few-shot viewpoint estimation. We demonstrate on both tasks the benefits of guiding the network prediction with class-representative features extracted from data in different modalities: image patches for object detection, and aligned 3D models for viewpoint estimation. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on a range of datasets, including PASCAL and COCO for few-shot object detection, and Pascal3D+ and ObjectNet3D for few-shot viewpoint estimation. Furthermore, when the 3D model is not available, we introduce a simple category-agnostic viewpoint estimation method by exploiting geometrical similarities and consistent pose labeling across different classes. While it moderately reduces performance, this approach still obtains better results than previous methods in this setting. Last, for the first time, we tackle the combination of both few-shot tasks, on three challenging benchmarks for viewpoint estimation in the wild, ObjectNet3D, Pascal3D+ and Pix3D, showing very promising results.
