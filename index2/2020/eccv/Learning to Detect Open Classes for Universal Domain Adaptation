Confidence has contour lines where all class distributions on the line share the same confidence. In the paper, we claim that confidence has high discriminability for extremely confident and uncertain predictions, meaning that the contour line for extremely high and low confidence should be short. For each confidence, the length of contour line is proportional to the number of possible value combinations of probabilities, i.e. the size of solution space, satisfying the confidence. If the confidence is larger than 0.5, meaning that the highest probability is higher than 0.5, and the sum of the rest probabilities is smaller than 0.5. Let the three probabilities pi, (i = 1, ..., n) without loss of generality, we let p1 be the largest probabilities. Then we have
