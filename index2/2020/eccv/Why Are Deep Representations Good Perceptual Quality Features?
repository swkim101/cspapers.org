One of the most important perceptual aspects of Human Visual System (HVS) is the relation between its contrast sensitivity and spatial frequency. This relation is explained by the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) which is estimated by psychophysical experiments involving spatial sine-wave gratings. Our input generation routine is closely related to those input stimuli which are used in CSF experiments. In order to make CSF function independent from a specific display device, the spatial frequency is defined in cycles per degree (c/deg) units. When a display device is used in experiments, it requires a conversion to device dependent units, which is cycles per pixel. The conversion between those two types of units can be expressed as a series of simple mathematical formulas using viewing distance and physical dimensions of the screen. In our experiments, we generate input gratings using cycles per pixel units on a hypothetical display. In order to convert the spatial frequencies from CSF into cycles per pixel, we fix viewing at a retinal resolution of 60 pixels per degree (PPD) [5]. The relation between cycles per pixel, cycles per degree is and pixels per degree is: cycles pixel = cycles degree × ( pixels degree )−1, (1)
