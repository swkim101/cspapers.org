Existing view recommendation approaches proposed a variety of utility functions in selecting useful views. Even though each utility function might be suitable for specific scenarios, identifying the most appropriate ones, along with their tunable parameters, which represent the user's intention during an exploration, is a challenge for both expert and non-expert users. This paper presents an attempt towards interactive view recommendation that automatically discovers the utility function composition during an exploration that best matches the user's intentions and exploration task.
