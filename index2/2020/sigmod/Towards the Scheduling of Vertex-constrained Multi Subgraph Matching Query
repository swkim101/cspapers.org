Subgraph matching is one of the most fundamental problems in graph database, which is associated with a wide spectrum of applications. Researchers have primarily devoted their efforts to improving performance for individual query, while we often need to compute multiple queries all at once in practice. In this paper, we study the problem of vertex-constrained multi subgraph matching query (vMSQ), where we propose a novel scheduling algorithm for processing multiple queries in parallel, while taking into considerations of load balance and maximum possible sharing of computation.
