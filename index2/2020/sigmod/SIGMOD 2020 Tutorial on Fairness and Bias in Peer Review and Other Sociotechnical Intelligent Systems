Questions of fairness and bias abound in all socially-consequential decisions pertaining to collection and management of data. Whether designing protocols for peer review of research papers, setting hiring policies, or framing research question in genetics, any data-management decision with the potential to allocate benefits or confer harms raises concerns about who gains or loses that may fail to surface in naively-chosen performance measures. Data science interacts with these questions in two fundamentally different ways: (i) as the technology driving the very systems responsible for certain social impacts, posing new questions about what it means for such systems to accord with ethical norms and the law; and (ii) as a set of powerful tools for analyzing existing data management systems, e.g., for auditing existing systems for various biases. This tutorial will tackle both angles on the interaction between technology and society vis-a-vis concerns over fairness and bias, particularly focusing on the collection and management of data. Our presentation will cover a wide range of disciplinary perspectives with the first part focusing on the social impacts of technology and the formulations of fairness and bias defined via protected characteristics and the second part taking a deep into peer review and distributed human evaluations, to explore other forms of bias, such as that due to subjectivity, miscalibration, and dishonest behavior.
