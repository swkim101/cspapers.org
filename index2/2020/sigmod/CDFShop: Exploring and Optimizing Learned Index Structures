Indexes are a critical component of data management applications. While tree-like structures (e.g., B-Trees) have been employed to great success, recent work suggests that index structures powered by machine learning models (learned index structures) can achieve low lookup times with a reduced memory footprint. This demonstration showcases CDFShop, a tool to explore and optimize recursive model indexes (RMIs), a type of learned index structure. This demonstration allows audience members to (1) gain an intuition about various tuning parameters of RMIs and why learned index structures can greatly accelerate search, and (2) understand how automatic optimization techniques can be used to explore space/time tradeoffs within the space of RMIs.
