Given a social network G with n nodes and m edges, a positive integer k, and a cascade model C, the influence maximization (IM) problem asks for k nodes in G such that the expected number of nodes influenced by the k nodes under cascade model C is maximized. The state-of-the-art approximate solutions run in O(k(n+m)log(n)/ε2) expected time while returning a (1-1/e -ε) approximate solution with at least 1-1/n probability. A key phase of these IM algorithms is the random reverse reachable (RR) set generation, and this phase significantly affects the efficiency and scalability of the state-of-the-art IM algorithms. In this paper, we present a study on this key phase and propose an efficient random RR set generation algorithm under IC model. With the new algorithm, we show that the expected running time of existing IM algorithms under IC model can be improved to O(k· n log(n)/ε2), when for any node v, the total weight of its incoming edges is no larger than a constant. Moreover, existing approximate IM algorithms suffer from scalability issues in high influence networks where the size of random RR sets is usually quite large. We tackle this challenging issue by reducing the average size of random RR sets without sacrificing the approximation guarantee. The proposed solution is orders of magnitude faster than states of the art as shown in our experiment.
