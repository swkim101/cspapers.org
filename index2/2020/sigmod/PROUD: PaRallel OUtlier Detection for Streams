We introduce PROUD, standing for PaRallel OUtlier Detection for streams, which is an extensible engine for continuous multi-parameter parallel distance-based outlier (or anomaly) detection tailored to big data streams. PROUD is built on top of Flink. It defines a simple API for data ingestion. It supports a variety of parallel techniques, including novel ones, for continuous outlier detection that can be easily configured. In addition, it graphically reports metrics of interest and stores main results into a permanent store to enable future analysis. It can be easily extended to support additional techniques. Finally, it is publicly provided in open-source.
