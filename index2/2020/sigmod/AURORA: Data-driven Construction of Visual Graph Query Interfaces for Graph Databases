Several commercial and academic frameworks for querying a large collection of small- or medium-sized data graphs (eg. chemical compounds) provide visual graph query interfaces (a.k.a GUI) to facilitate non-programmers to query these sources. However, construction of these visual interfaces is not data-driven. That is, it does not exploit the underlying data graphs to automatically generate the contents of various panels in a GUI. Such data-driven construction has several benefits such as facilitating efficient subgraph query formulation and portability of the interface across different application domains and sources. In this demonstration, we present a novel data-driven visual subgraph query interface construction engine called AURORA. Specifically, given a graph repository D containing a collection of small- or medium-sized data graphs, it automatically generates the GUI for D by populating various components of the interface. We demonstrate various innovative features of AURORA.
