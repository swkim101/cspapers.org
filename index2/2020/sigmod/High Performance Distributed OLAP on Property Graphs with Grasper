Achieving high performance OLAP over large graphs is a challenging problem and has received great attention recently because of its broad spectrum of applications. Existing systems have various performance bottlenecks due to limitations such as low parallelism and high network overheads. This Demo presents Grasper, an RDMA-enabled distributed graph OLAP system, which adopts a series of new system designs to overcome the challenges of OLAP on graphs. The take-aways for Demo attendees are: (1)~a good understanding of the challenges of processing graph OLAP queries; (2)~useful insights about where Grasper's good performance comes from; (3)~inspirations about how to design an efficient graph OLAP system by comparing Grasper with existing systems.
