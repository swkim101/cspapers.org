The database research community has been spectacularly successful in impacting the industry and academia since the invention of the relational model. Examples of innovation in the last decade include columnar storage for data analytic platforms, cloud data services, HTAP systems, and a new generation of data wrangling systems. Despite this success, critical self-assessment by the community and identifying key opportunities for the future is essential if we are to continue the tradition of impactful research. In the Fall of 2018, following a long tradition that dates back to 1988 [1], and five years after the last such meeting [2], a group of approximately thirty database researchers gathered at the University of Washington, Seattle for two days to discuss the opportunities we have as a community for impactful research. A report from that meeting is now available [3]. The discussions in the Seattle meeting focused not just on technical challenges and opportunities but also on topics related to how we organize ourselves as a community. This SIGMOD panel will provide a forum for the broader database community to review and debate the findings from the Seattle Report on Database Research [3] as well as to identify other challenges, and opportunities that need to be taken into account.
