Data analysis for scientific experiments and enterprises, large-scale simulations, and machine learning tasks all entail the use of complex computational pipelines to reach quantitative and qualitative conclusions. If some of the activities in a pipeline produce erroneous outputs, the pipeline may fail to execute or produce incorrect results. Inferring the root cause(s) of such failures is challenging, usually requiring time and much human thought, while still being error-prone. We recently proposed a new approach that makes provenance to automatically and iteratively infer root causes and derive succinct explanations of failures; such an approach was implemented in our prototype, BugDoc. In this demonstration, we will illustrate BugDoc's capabilities to debug pipelines using few configuration instances.
