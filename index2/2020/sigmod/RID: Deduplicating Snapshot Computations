One can audit SQL applications by running SQL programs over sequences of persistent snapshots, but care is needed to avoid wasteful duplicate computation. This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance of RID, the first language-independent optimization framework that eliminates duplicate computations in SQL programs running over low-level snapshots by exploiting snapshot metadata efficiently.
