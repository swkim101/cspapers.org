Problem and Motivation As one of the most common and expensive database management system operators, join plays an important role in the query response time and/or throughput of the system. Although the processing and performance evaluation of multi-join queries has been the topic of research for the past decades [8, 12, 13], the complexity and multi-dimensional nature of the problem makes it an unsolved problem for the database community. Our work studies the performance of different classes of query plans, memory distributions for join operators, intraquery concurrency under different assumptions of memory availability, and storage devices such as HDD and SSD. This provides the foundation for understanding basic “join physics”, which is useful for designing a resourcebased query scheduler for concurrent workloads. We use AsterixDB [1] utilizing both HDD and SSD, to re-evaluate the results of one of the early impactful studies from the 1990s [12] that was originally done using a simulator for the Gamma database system [4].
