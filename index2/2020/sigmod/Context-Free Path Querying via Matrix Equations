Context-free path querying (CFPQ) widely used for graph-structured data analysis in different areas. It is crucial to develop highly efficient algorithms for CFPQ since the size of the input data is typically large. We show how to reduce GFPQ evaluation to solving systems of matrix equations over R --- a problem for which there exist high-performance solutions. Also, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-world data analysis.
