This paper presents Always Encrypted, a recently released feature of Microsoft SQL Server that uses column granularity encryption to provide cryptographic data protection guarantees. Always Encrypted can be used to outsource database administration while keeping the data confidential from an administrator, including cloud operators. The first version of Always Encrypted was released in Azure SQL Database and as part of SQL Server 2016, and supported equality operations over deterministically encrypted columns. The second version, released as part of SQL Server 2019, uses an enclave running within a trusted execution environment to provide richer functionality that includes comparison and string pattern matching for an IND-CPA-secure (randomized) encryption scheme. We present the security, functionality, and design of Always Encrypted, and provide a performance evaluation using the TPC-C benchmark.
