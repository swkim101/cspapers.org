We describe how GSQL, TigerGraph's graph query language, supports the specification of aggregation in graph analytics. GSQL makes several unique design decisions with respect to both the expressive power and the evaluation complexity of the specified aggregation. We detail our design showing how our ideas transcend GSQL and are eminently portable to the upcoming graph query language standards as well as the existing pattern-based declarative query languages.
