The proliferation of mobile phones and location-based services gives rise to an explosive growth of spatial data. This spatial data contains valuable information, and calls for data stream warehouse systems that can provide real-time analytical results with the latest integrated spatial data. In this demonstration, we present the STAR (Spatial Data Stream Warehouse) system. STAR is a distributed in-memory spatial data stream warehouse system that provides low-latency and up-to-date analytical results over a fast spatial data stream. STAR supports a rich set of aggregate queries for spatial data analytics, e.g., contrasting the frequencies of spatial objects that appear in different spatial regions, or showing the most frequently mentioned topics being tweeted in different cities. STAR processes aggregate queries by maintaining distributed materialized views. Additionally, STAR supports dynamic load adjustment that makes STAR scalable and adaptive. We demonstrate STAR on top of Amazon EC2 clusters using real data sets.
